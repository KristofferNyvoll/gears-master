Master Thesis Project - Gears
===
Generic Educational Autonomous Robotics Simulator

This simulator was created to allow anyone to experiment with robotics without owning a robot.

The original fork by QuirkyCort (https://github.com/QuirkyCort) was further developed by two master students (https://github.com/KristofferNyvoll and https://github.com/yvindo) to test a Master's Thesis at NTNU.
